## Description

The API I developed using Nest.js is designed to provide users with the ability to create, update, and delete photoposts.

The API is structured around a set of RESTful endpoints that correspond to different operations on photoposts. These endpoints are implemented using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and they conform to standard RESTful conventions.

In addition to providing basic CRUD functionality for photoposts, the API also includes some additional features such as authentication and validation. These features help ensure that the API is secure and that the data being received and processed by the API is valid and conforms to the expected format.
